## Buck Converter to 5V


## USB Hub Design Checklist
1 Are the decoupling capacitors and bulk capacitors connected as per Figure 1 and Figure 2? Y
2 Does the crystal meet the specification in this application note?  Y
3 Are all DS ports provided with 150-µF bulk capacitors?
4 Do the Power-on-Reset RC components meet the minimum reset time (5 ms)?
5 Do the USB precision resistors have 1% tolerance? 
6 Are the I2C lines provided with pull-up resistors to the 3.3-V domain?
7 Do the LEDs connected to the pin-strap pins have a 10-kΩ parallel resistor?
8
Is it ensured that the DS port power switch has a MOSFET connected to the OUTPUT pin or selected a power switch with
fast discharge?
9 Is the VBUS_US pin provided with a 10-kΩ voltage divider network?
10 Is the US port provided with 1-µF bulk capacitor?
11 Are all port shields terminated properly?
12 Are the ferrite beads connected as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2?
